=== Fellipe Brito's dot files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

== Installation

  git clone https://github.com/fellipebrito/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install

  Vim plugins are managed through pathogen and they all are on the submodules.

== Problems

(Mac) -bash: __git_ps1: command not found
